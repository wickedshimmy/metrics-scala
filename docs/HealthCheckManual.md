# Health Check support

    Health check support is available since metrics-scala v3.0.3.

Metrics also has the ability to centralize your serviceâ€™s health checks with the metrics-healthchecks module.

Metrics-healthchecks requires health checks to be registered in an application wide `HealthCheckRegistry`. Metrics-scala hides use of it, but you do need to create an `Checked` trait that refers to that registry. Your `Checked` needs to extends `CheckedBuilder`. (See also [About Checked](#about-checked-and-instrumented) below.)

```scala
object YourApplication {
  /** The application wide health check registry. */
  val healthCheckRegistry = new com.codahale.metrics.health.HealthCheckRegistry();
}
trait Checked extends nl.grons.metrics.scala.CheckedBuilder {
  val registry = Application.healthCheckRegistry
}
```

Now you can easily create and register health checks by using the `healthCheck` factory method:

```scala
package com.example

class Example(db: Database) extends Checked {
  healthCheck("database") { db.isConnected }
}
```

This creates and registers a health check named `com.example.Example.database` that is healthy when `db.isConnected` returns `true`, and unhealthy with the default message `Health check failed` when it returns `false`. You can override the unhealthy message as follows:

```scala
healthCheck("database", unhealthyMessage = "Ouch!") { db.isConnected }
```

The code block may also return a `Try` (version 3.2.0 and later), an `Either` or a `com.codahale.metrics.health.HealthCheck.Result`. In these cases the `unhealthyMessage` is always ignored.

For more details see the scaladoc in [CheckedBuilder](/src/main/scala/nl/grons/metrics/scala/CheckedBuilder.scala).

### Warning for version 3.1.x and earlier

Due to the way the Scala compiler works you have to be careful with inline health checks that contain multiple statements.

```scala
class Example(db: Database) extends Checked {
  var counter: Int = 0
  healthCheck("database") {
    counter += 1        // <-- executed only once!
    counter % 2 == 0    // <-- the actually health check, however this will return the same value always!
  }
}
```

In this example the compiler only takes the last expression in the block as the health check. As a solution either upgrade to metrics-scala 3.2 or later, or change your code such that the last expression in the block contains all your logic. For example:

```scala
class Example(db: Database) extends Checked {
  var counter: Int = 0
  healthCheck("database") {
    def check(): Boolean = {
      counter += 1
      counter % 2 == 0
    }
    check()
  }
}
```

The issue has been fixed in version 3.2.0. See also [issue 42](https://github.com/erikvanoosten/metrics-scala/issues/42).

## Health check names

Each health check has a unique name. In metrics-scala the name starts with a name derived from the *owner class*.
The owner class is the class that extends the `Checked` trait you defined earlier.

The health check name is build from:

* *Metric base name* By default this is set to the owner class name (e.g., `com.example.proj.auth.SessionStore`).
* *Name:* A short name describing the health check (e.g., `database`).

Since 3.1.0 the *metric base name* can be overridden. For example by using `Checked` as follows:

```scala
class Example extends Checked {
  override lazy val metricBaseName = MetricName("Overridden.Base.Name")
  ....
}
```


## About `Checked` and `Instrumented`

Although all Metrics-scala documentation refers to the `Checked` trait (as created in the text above), you are free to chose the name, or in fact not to use it at all. It is also possible to directly extend `CheckedBuilder` and provide an implementation of `registry` in every class.

There is also opportunity to combine your `Instrumented` and `Checked` in a single trait:

```scala
import nl.grons.metrics.scala._

object YourApplication {
  /** The application wide metrics registry. */
  val metricRegistry = new com.codahale.metrics.MetricRegistry()
  /** The application wide health check registry. */
  val healthCheckRegistry = new com.codahale.metrics.health.HealthCheckRegistry();
}

trait Instrumented extends InstrumentedBuilder with CheckedBuilder {
  override lazy val metricBaseName = MetricName(getClass) // Required with 3.1.0, optional since 3.1.1.
  val metricRegistry = YourApplication.metricRegistry
  val registry = YourApplication.healthCheckRegistry
}
```

In this variant `Instrumented` supports both building metrics and health checks.
